# There is only one pig at 70 feet. The user kills the pig if the distance travelled
# by the bird is the total distance+-2 feet.
# Ask the user speed (>=0) and angle ([0-90]).
# These are the equations that you have to express to calculate the distance travelled
# by the bird launched
# distance=speed^2*sin(2*alpha)/G
# radians=degrees*PI/180.0
# The speed is how fast (in feet per second) you launch the bird, alpha
# is the angle with the horizontal that you launch it.
# Zero degrees would be flat on the ground, 90 degrees would be straight up.
# Use 32.2(feet per second squared) for the constant G.The function sin from the math
# library must have radians as its argument. The input angle from the user (alpha)
# will be in degrees so some conversion must be done. The distance travelled
# must be printed with 2 decimal places.
# Print "The pig is dead", "too short" or "too far", depending on the distance

# The user keeps playing until he types 0 for speed.
# Sample output:
# Angry Birds!
# The pig is 70 feet far away
# What speed to launch at (fps) (0 to stop)? 50
# What angle (in degrees)? 33
# For a bird launched at 50 feet per sec with an angle of 33 degrees
# from the horizontal the distance travelled is 70.93 feet
# You killed the pig.
# Angry Birds!
# The pig is 70 feet far away
# What speed to launch at (fps) (0 to stop)? 0
# Good bye!!
